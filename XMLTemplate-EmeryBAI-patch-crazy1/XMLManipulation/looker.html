<h1>Welcome to the STACK Question Generation System. You will learn how to generate some basic STACK questions here. Please follow  instructions in blue boxes to generate an expected question.</h1>

<blockquote><ol><li>Read through the <strong>Question Type Directory</strong> and choose a question type  expected to generate. (See the demo to get better intution about question type)</li></ol></blockquote>

<h2>Question Type Directory</h2>

<ol><li>Simple calculation questions:
Students need to fill in a box with mathematical expression or number:   <a href="C:\Users\huiyubai2\Desktop\imgDemo\simpCalc.png">See the demo here</a></li><li>True/False questions
Students need to choose between two options: True/False.  <a href="C:\Users\huiyubai2\Desktop\imgDemo\simpCalc.png">See the demo here</a></li></ol>

<blockquote><p>2.Read through Introduction to the simple Calculation Question and Question Generation Priority to get better understanding about what you can do with STACK simple calculation questions, and <strong>choose related priority</strong>. Then detailed information and demos will be provided. After you have manipulate related options, click the <strong>&quot;Confirm&quot;</strong>. An XML file will be generated. The following step will be shown once you click the button. </p></blockquote>

<h2>Introduction to the simple Calculation Question:</h2>

<p><a href="https://eq1302.cs.cityu.edu.hk/question/preview.php?id=4049&amp;cmid=782">See an example here</a>
Like other STACK questions, simple calculation questions contain three main parts: question title, question text, question answer.
1. Question title: A question title is used to identify a question in a question bank. As the example below shows, a question is titled as FillinBlankQ-SimpleCalc, the question is represented by its question title.
&lt;!--questionTitle.png---&gt;
2. Question text:
In question text for simple calculation questions, normally numbers or mathmatical expressions are included. For example:
&lt;!--questionText.png---&gt;</p>

<ol><li><p>Question answer: question answer will check the result of students&#39; inputs. For example:
This is an correct answer:
&lt;!--correct.png---&gt;
This is a wrong answer:
&lt;!--wrong.png---&gt;</p></li><li><p>Advanced function-- Randomization:
Suppose there a question text with some numbers or expressions . Furthermore, we can generate different question variants <strong>randomly</strong> for the question. This means that different students may get different versions of the question generated with diverse numbers or expressions.  Let&#39;s take the question generated in the above as an example. 
&lt;!--2question.png---&gt;
The randomization can be used in higher priority. For details, please refer to the <strong>Question Generation Priority</strong>.</p></li></ol>

<h2>Question Generation Priority</h2>

<p>To make ones get familiar to STACK question step by step, we generate three priorities, from low to high:  Beginner, Intermedia, Professional.
Here is the difference:
- Beginner
Write explicit question text and answers.
- Intermedia
Use the advanced randomization function, but the range of numbers can not be controlled by users.
- Professional
Use the advanced randomization function, users can customize the range of random numbers.</p>

<h1>第三部分在分支页面，介绍权能的具体实现方式，（要提供案例）</h1>

<p>3.1 01选项</p>

<blockquote><p>In beginner level, you should input the following three parts. Here we have already prepare a demo question which have already filled the form. <a href="www">The output is here</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>3.2 02选项</p>

<blockquote><p>In Intermedia level, you need to use variable names to represent random numbers. Besides three main parts, you need to add variables in your question text. Please use {@ @} to include the variable name in the question text. And give the variable name and lowerbound of the variable value in the variable table below. Furthermore, you should also determine 
    how many variants you want to determined. A demo code is shown below.
</p></blockquote>

<p>3.3 03选项</p>

<blockquote><p>In Professional level, you should input the variable names, the lower bound and the upper bound for variables.</p></blockquote>

<h1>第四部分在generate 出来之后，进行具体操作 建议拍摄gif图片</h1>

<p>Please copy the xml code below and create a new file with the suffix xml on your computer. Paste the code into the new file. 
    Then enter the setting page of the quiz you want to add. click import , 
    select your newly created file, and the categories you want to place. then import.
    Then you can find the question in question bank.

    For Intermedia and professional level, 


For intermedia level, and professional level, we also to do the further deployment here to generate questions in related number.</p>
